# Week 4 Assessment

Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.


#### 1. What is a method in Ruby? How is it different or similar to functions in JavaScript?
A method in Ruby is really similar to a function except in Ruby you can combine more than one statement in order to have less methods.

#### 2. What does it mean that a class inherits from another class? Try to explain Ruby inheritance.


[Your Answer]
Ruby inheritance is when a parent "lends" the child the qualities and actions of the parent class. So in english, inheritance would be parents having their children on their phone plan. The parent gives the child the phone and they are getting all the benefits but they themselves could not add someone to the plan.

[Googled Answer]
"Inheritance allows the programmer to inherit the characteristics of one class into another class."

#### 3. What is rspec and what is the general process for writing tests in RSpec?

//Your Answer
rspec is a testing framework. The general process for writing tests in rspec would be using describe to say what we want it to do , to do what it should do , and what to expect expectation.  

//Googled Answer
RSpec is a testing tool for Ruby, created for behavior-driven development (BDD).

#### 4. Name three possible non-inheritance relationships between ruby objects?

//Your Answer

//Googled Answer
I can't find anything on non-inheritance.

#### 5. What do we call the #{} convention used below? What is it accomplishing?

String interpolation. It takes a value and calls it in a string and allows you to call it without using multiple strings.

```ruby
x = 1022
puts "I am printing a random number #{x}"
```

#### 6. How do you feel about testing right now? What potential pros/cons/barriers/advantages do you see to implementing BDD in your own code?

//Your Answer
I feel okay about testing right now because it's on a basic level. I think the barriers when we get to testing I'm going to have a hard time with writing the test first. I need to practice writing the test before and how that translates to code. I'm still confused about how to go about it. The pros would be avoiding headache later and getting most bugs out before I get too deep in.

#### 7. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from a normal, local variable?

//Your Answer
An instance variable is available everywhere in the program and a local is only available in the file.

//Googled Answer
An instance variable is a variable that is accessible in any instance method in a particular instance of a class.

#### 8. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. Here is the long list of great resources: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/. Below are a few popular ones:
- Interactive Ruby tutorial (http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby: comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries (http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html)
- Ruby in 20 min (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)


Choose one of these resources and go through the material (not for hours, only looking for around 10min of your time) then come back here and list a few new things you learned about Ruby.

You can use IRB as a calculator which is pretty cool and the amount of math built in is insane!
You're about to change variables really easy which could be useful in a really long program.
There is something called a MegaGreeter class where the rest of the files calls methods on that class.
